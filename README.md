# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project is developed to predict customer churn using bank data. 
In the bank industry, the customer churn has been increasingly critical for their bussiness.
In order to keep their customer, predict customers with high risk of churn and
investigate their characteristics are crucial.
In this project, machine learning models to predict the risk of churn for
each customer are built. Also, feature importance plot is provided to
make sure features that affect the risk of the customer churn.


## Files and data description
The data used in this project must be stored in data directory.
The data type must be csv file with `bank_data.csv` file name.
You can access data used in this project from Kaggle website.

## Environment
This project assume python `version 3.8`.
You can build environment as following steps using `conda`.
 
 - `docker compose up -d --build --wait`

## Running Files
Before you run, please check if the code work correctly. To do this, run `pytest` as following steps.

- Open terminal
- Move directory to the project root directory
- Run `conda activate predict_customer_churn`
- Run `pytest`

You must pass all the test implemented in test/test/test_churn_script_logging.py
After checking all test has passed, run 
`python src/churn_library.py` to build model.
After Finished running, Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier model are saved in `models` directory.
You can verify performances of each models by checking classification report, feature_importances, roc_curve stored in `images` directory.
